#TableTopTuesday a 3rd party vendor of yours suffers a ransomware attack, and reaches out to let you know that some of your company’s critical data was leaked. your threat intelligence tools verify that this data is currently for sale on the dark web.

what do you do?

Plot twist: 
The 3rd party only admits to having identified suspicious activity on their network, have started investigating and are taking the security of your data seriously.
Your TI team identifies this as a ransomware incident and finds your data on sale on the dark web.

Activate our CSIRT, damage is done so it’s going to leadership, comms, and privacy to handle. SecOps will elevate current analysis of logs between us and the 3rd party as well as hunt log archives. Probably kick off an org wide vuln reassess.
Pretty much exactly our plan for when this finally happens.  We keep trying the last part and spend tons to do so, but the variety of user positions means we will eventually be hit because there's little in the way of consequences for many individuals.

Use IRT to identify the data at risk, create war rooms and activate your IR plan. Determine the scope and impact to your customers and work with your lawyers, and the vendor to come up with robust remediation and Comms plans. Notifying regulators where necessary.
(Also callout for War Room, not war cubicle)

LOL at this reply: Listen to a bunch of unqualified C-suite execs ask questions like “why do we even use this vendor? Why don’t we just switch or develop it ourselves”.

Part Two: SOC: gather data; find user attrib indicators to ID/ctrl leakage (who had data contact, see “around” event), coordinate IR-C w/ third party, WRITE SOLID NOTES. 
Interns: Sign NDA off 2  StarBucks, disposable PC’s, pummel search engines to see who is reposting what.
